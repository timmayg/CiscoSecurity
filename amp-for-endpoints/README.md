This is a respository for some Powershell scripts I wrote to interact with the AMP for Endpoints API. This is a very basic way to interact with these endpoints. I can provide limited support for these APIs. 

Source documentation for these APIs is here:
https://api-docs.amp.cisco.com/api_resources?api_host=api.amp.cisco.com&api_version=v1

In order to work with any of these Powershell scripts you will need to update the following lines. 
$clientid='enter-your-client-id'
$apikey='enter-your-api-key'


Please read the file AMPforEndpoints

Thanks for checking these out!   Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
