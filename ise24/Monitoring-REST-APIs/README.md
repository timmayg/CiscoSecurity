The Monitoring REST API allows allow you to gather session and node-specific information by using Monitoring nodes in your network. A session is defined as the duration between when you access a desired node and complete the operations needed to gather information.

Monitoring REST API calls allow you to locate, monitor, and accumulate important real-time, session-based information stored in individual endpoints in a network. You can access this information through a Monitoring node.

The real-time, session-based information that you gather can help understand Cisco ISE operations and assist in diagnosing conditions or issues. It can also be used to troubleshoot error conditions or an activity or behavior that may be affecting monitoring operations
