# Cisco Security

My name is Tim and I work for Cisco Systems. I've been a Network \ Security Engineer my entire adult lifetime. 
I'm focused on Enterprise Networking, Security and scripting.   I've been writing Powershell since version 1 back in 2008 
WinXP.  All the scripts you will find here will be in Powershell.  

Scripts here will cover 
* AMP for Endpoints
* ISE v2.4
*
